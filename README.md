# 🌟 CultureGR

## 📚 Project Overview
**CultureGR** is a web platform that presents all the cultural landmarks of Greece—including museums, monuments, cultural centers, and more. The goal of this project is to offer users an engaging way to explore Greece's rich cultural heritage. The platform distinguishes between two main user roles:

- **Editorial Team Members:**  
  They can map, edit, and add new records (e.g., new museums, archaeological sites, etc.) to keep the content fresh and up-to-date.

- **Readers:**  
  They are encouraged to leave comments and rate the entries, thereby contributing to an interactive community experience.

Developed using **.NET 8** and **C# 12** in **Visual Studio 2022** and powered by **SQL Server Express**, CultureGR combines modern web technologies with a robust database backend.
